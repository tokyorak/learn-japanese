# Snack time Topic

This topic introduces two very important words in Japanese, `これ`(kore) and `それ`(sore)

| Japanese | English |
| --- | --- |
| これ | this, this one |
| それ | that, that one |

Keep in mind that `これ` is used to describe things that are close to the speaker, just like the English "this one". `それ` is used to describe things that are close to the listener, just like the English "that one".
