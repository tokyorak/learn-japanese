## Introduction to Kanji

This lesson introduces the non-phonetic writing system of Japanese, kanji. **Kanji** literally means "Chinese characters", and they're used to build content words like nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

## Kanji readings

So how do you read kanji? Most kanji have at least two possible readings. Typically, one reading is derived from a native Japanese word, and one reading is derived from a Chinese loanword. These are called "kunyomi" ("meaning reading") and "onyomi" ("sound reading") respectively.

Let's take the kanji for "country", `国`. On its own, we use the Japanese "kunyomi" reading, `くに`. In Japanese, `くに` means "country". However, in compounds, we use the "onyomi" reading of `こく`. Therefore, China `中国` or "middle country", is read as `ちゅうごく`.

## Rendaku

So why isn't it `ちゅうこく`? This is due to a phenomenon known as "rendaku" or "sequential voicing". Syllabes that come later in a word are sometimes voiced and marked with a dakuten. This is often rather unpredictable, so rendaku words should be memorized individually.

## Example kanji

| Kanji | Meaning | Kunyomi reading | Onyomi reading |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 人 | person | ひと | じん、にん |
| 中 | middle | なか | ちゅう |
| 国 | country | くに | こく |
| 日 | sun, day | ひ | にち、じつ |
| 本 | origin, book | もと | ほん |
| 田 | rice paddy | た | でん |

You may have noticed that the word Japan, or `日本` is composed of the kanji meaning "sun" and "origin". This word was first adopted by the Chinese, and to them, Japan was off to the east, the place where the sun rose or "originated".
