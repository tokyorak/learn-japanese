# Family topic 1

## Familial Terms

Japanese uses a number of terms for family members. Some use the honorific form, which is typically reserved for someone else's family members, while others use a shorter, more casual form, reserved for your own members.

Still, these rules are not hard and fast. You will still hear children use the honorific form to address their own mother or father.

| Family member | Honorific form | Personal form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Older brother | お兄さん　.　おにいさん | 兄　.　あに |
| Older sister | お姉さん　.　おねえさん | 姉　.　あね |
| Younger brother | 弟さん　.　おとうとさん | 弟　.　おとうと |
| Younger sister | 妹さん　.　いもうとさん | 妹　.　いもうと |
| Child | お子さん　.　おこさん | 子供　.　こども |
| Parents | ご両親　.　ごりょうしん | 両親　.　りょうしん |
| Father | お父さん　.　おとうさん | 父　.　ちち |
| Mother | お母さん　.　おかあさん | 母　.　はは |
| Grandfather | お祖父さん　.　おじいさん | 祖父　.　そふ |
| Grandmother | お祖母さん　.　おばあさん | 祖母　.　そぼ |
| Uncle older than parent | 伯父さん　.　おじさん | 伯父　.　おじ |
| Aunt older than parent |　伯母さん　.　おばさん | おば |
| Uncle younger than parent | 叔父さん　.　おじさん | 叔父　.　おじ |
| Aunt younger than parent | 叔母さん　.　おばさん | 叔母　.　おば |
| Husband | ご主人　.　ごしゅじん | 夫　.　おっと |
| Wife | 奥さん 　.　おくさん| 妻　.　つま |

**Both father and mother are well**: chichi mo haha mo genki desu 父も母も　元気　です
Notice that id you have two nouns, you can put `も` after each one to mean `both` my father `and` my mother!

Saying words like **my** and **your** is easy in Japanese! Just add `の` to words like `I` and `you`

| Pronoun | Possessive pronoun |
| --- | --- |
| 私　.　わたし　.　I | 私の　.　わたしの　.　my |
| あなた　.　you | あなたの　.　 your|
| 彼　.　かれ　.　he | 彼の　.　かれの　.　his |
| 彼女　.　かのじょ　.　she | 彼女の　.　かのじょの　.　her |
| 彼ら　.　かれら　.　they | 彼らの　.　かれらの　.　their |

**What is his name**: kare no namae ha nandesuka 彼の　名前　は　何ですか

**How old is your child**: Anata no kodomo ha nan-sai desuka　あなたの　子供　は　何歳　ですか

By the way! `彼ら　.　かれら` generally refers to men, or a group where men are the majority. For groups of women, you can use `彼女たち　.　かのじょたち`

## Counting people

Remember, when you count nouns, you need to use a **counter** with the number. We've seen `人` in words like `日本人　.　nihonjin`. This kanji means person, and you also use it to count people.

| Number | Counter |
| --- | --- |
| 1 　.　一| 一人　.　**ひとり** |
| 2 　.　二| 二人　.　**ふたり** |
| 3 　.　三| 三人　.　さんにん |
| 4 　.　四| 四人　.　よにん |
| 5 　.　五| 五人　.　ごにん |
| 6 　.　六| 六人　.　ろくにん |
| 7 　.　七| 七人　.　しちにん |
| 8 　.　八| 八人　.　はちにん |
| 9 　.　九| 九人　.　きゅうにん |
| 10　.　十 | 十人　.　じゅうにん |

`一人` and `二人` have irregular pronunciation. But from `三` and up, you can pretty much just add `人`! Notice that with numbers, it's pronounced `にん`

## Househole phrases

When someone leaves or comes home, there are some customary phrases Japanes people say! It's a bit more meaningfull than just saying **Goodbye**! The phrases express a promise from and a wish for the person to return safely.

**I'm off**: Ittekimasu 行ってきます

**Take care**: Itterasshai 行ってらっしゃい

When someone comes back home, there's another pair of phrases to announce their presence, and to acknowledge them in return!

**I'm home**: tadaima　ただいまー

**Welcome back**: Okaerinasai おかえりなさい

## Vocabulary

**Who**
: dare 誰　.　だれ
**Who are you**: dare desuka 誰ですか
**Who is he**: kare ha dare desuka 彼は　誰ですか
**Who is that**: are ha dare desuka あれは　誰ですか

**Her name is sakura**: Kanojo no namae ha sakura desu 彼女の　名前は　さくらです
**He is in the restroom**: kare ha toire ni imasu 彼は　トイレに　います
