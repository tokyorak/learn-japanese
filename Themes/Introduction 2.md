# Introduction Topic 2

## Basic grammar

One thing that makes Japanese very different from English is the Japanese tendency to **drop the subject of the sentence** when the meaning is clear from context. Statements usually refer to oneself, while question usually address the person you're speaking with.

## The question marker

Adding question marker `か` at the end will make the affirmative (positive) sentence into question. If the sentences end in `です`, it's easy to formulate question by using `ですか`.

| Positive | Question |
| --- | --- |
| アメリカ人です (I'm American) | アメリカ人ですか (Are you American?) |
| 学生です (I'm a student) | 学生ですか (Are you a student?) |

## Pronouns

Pronouns are relatively rare in Japanese, but they are sometimes used to explicitly specify the subject or topic of a sentence. Below are some of most common ones.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First | 私　．わたし is used in polite settings by women and men, used by women in most other settings.<br/>僕　．ぼく is used by men in informal settings | 私たち　．わたしたち is most common. 我々　．われわれ sounds rather stiff and business-like. |
| Second | あなた is used in polite settings, however, if you know someone's name, it's best to call them by their name, typically followed by さん or せんせい.<br/>君　．きみ is used by men in informal settings specifically to those on or beneath one's social level. | あなたたち is used in formal settings,<br/>君たち　.　きみたち is used in informal settings, especially to subordinates. |
| Third - Male | 彼　．かれ | 彼ら　．かれら is also used for a mixed gendered group|
| Third - Female | 彼女　．かのじょ | 彼女たち　．かのじょたち |
