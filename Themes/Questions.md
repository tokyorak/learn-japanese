# Question Topic

To turn a polite statement into a question, all you need to do is add the particle `か` at the end of the sentence.

| Japanese |  English |
|---|---|
| いいです　| It's good |
|　いいですか　| **Is it** good|

We use `か` for all question types, regardless of whether we're talking about adjectives or nouns.

**What time do you go to bed?**
: nan ji **ni** nemasuka 何時　に　寝ますか
